## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

It is my first project with JavaScript so it wasn't easy, but I think on the first time it's good.

### Continued development

In 100% I need to study JavaScript.

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/textContent) - This helped me with adding text to HTML by JavaScript
